  "readme": "# react-native-gallery\n\nA pure JavaScript image gallery component for react-native apps with common gestures like pan, pinch and doubleTap, supporting both iOS and Android.\n\nThis component aims to be (one of ) the best image viewer for react-native apps. Comparing with other gallery alike components, this one should be more elegant in following aspects: (mimics iOS system photo album app)\n\n* Gesture handle: besides common pan, pinch and doubleTap, this component does well in targeting foucs point( or pivot) when zoom-in and zoom-out.\n* Responder switch: the gesture responder switch is more flexible than any other component, that is, the scrollable container and the wrapped image children perform well in acquiring and releasing gesture responder from/to each other.\n\nThis component works on react-native **0.28+** and only supports remote images for now.\n\n![](Demo/demo.gif)\n\n\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install --save react-native-gallery@latest`\n\n\n\n## Documentaion\n\nQuite easy to use:\n\n```\nimport Gallery from 'react-native-gallery';\n...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Gallery\n        style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black'}}\n        images={[\n          'http://p10.qhimg.com/t019e9cf51692f735be.jpg',\n          'http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/714a59a7tw1dxqkkg0cwlj.jpg',\n          'http://www.bz55.com/uploads/allimg/150122/139-150122145421.jpg'\n        ]}\n      />\n    );\n  }\n```\n\nThis component utilizes **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)** as the scrollable container and **[react-native-transformable-image](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-transformable-image)** as the wrapped image. \n\n#### Props\n\n* **images**: array, contains image urls\n* **initialPage**, **pageMargin**, **onPageSelected**, **onPageScrollStateChanged**, **onPageScroll**: inherited from **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)**. Check the link for more details.\n* **onSingleTapConfirmed**: Called after user single taped( not a double tap)\n* **onGalleryStateChanged**: function. (idle) => {}.\n\n\n\n\n### Add your custom views above image\n\nIt's a common practice to float a comment box or like button above the image. This component provides a convenient interface to implement this feature:\n\n- onSingleTapConfirmed(): a good time for you to display the responding floating view. \n- onGalleryStateChanged(idle): If *idle* is false, it's a good time for your to hide any floating views.\n\nCheck the Demo project for a simple demonstration.\n\n\n\n## Attention\n\nThis component is being actively developed but should be ready for production realease.\n\nIf you encounter any problem that seems unnormal, just create an issue or check out the latest release.\n\n\n## TODO\n\n* Dump off-screen images for better performance if needed",
