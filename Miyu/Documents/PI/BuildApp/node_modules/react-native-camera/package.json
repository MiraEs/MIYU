Including photographs, videos, and barcode scanning!\n\n### Contributing\n- Pull Requests are welcome, if you open a pull request we will do our best to get to it in a timely manner\n- Pull Request Reviews and even more welcome! we need help testing, reviewing, and updating open PRs\n- If you are interested in contributing more actively, please contact me (same username on Twitter, Facebook, etc.) Thanks!\n- We are now on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-camera#sponsor)! Contributions are appreciated and will be used to fund core contributors. [more details](#open-collective) \n\n#### Breaking Changes\n##### android build tools has been bumped to 25.0.2, please update (can be done via android cli or AndroidStudio)\n##### react-native header imports have changed in v0.40, and that means breaking changes for all! [Reference PR & Discussion](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera/pull/544).\n- if on react-native < 0.40: `npm i react-native-camera@0.4`\n- if on react-native >= 0.40 `npm i react-native-camera@0.6`\n\n##### Permissions\nTo enable `video recording` feature you have to add the following code to the `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n```\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\"/>\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_VIDEO\"/>\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n```\n\n![5j2jduk](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2302315/22190752/6bc6ccd0-e0da-11e6-8e2f-6f22a3567a57.gif)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Requirements\n1. JDK >= 1.7 (if you run on 1.6 you will get an error on \"_cameras = new HashMap<>();\")\n2. With iOS 10 and higher you need to add the \"Privacy - Camera Usage Description\" key to the info.plist of your project. This should be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'.  Add the following code:\n```\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>\n\n<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->\n<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>\n\n<!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the microphone for video recording -->\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your message to user when the microsphone is accessed for the first time</string>\n```\n3. On Android, you require `buildToolsVersion` of `25.0.2+`. _This should easily and automatically be downloaded by Android Studio's SDK Manager._\n\n### Mostly automatic install with react-native\n1. `npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save`\n3. `react-native link react-native-camera`\n\n### Mostly automatic install with CocoaPods\n1. `npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save`\n2. Add the plugin dependency to your Podfile, pointing at the path where NPM installed it:\n```\npod 'react-native-camera', path: '../node_modules/react-native-camera'\n```\n3. Run `pod install`\n\n### Manual install\n#### iOS\n1. `npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save`\n2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`\n3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-camera` and add `RCTCamera.xcodeproj`\n4. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRCTCamera.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`\n5. Click `RCTCamera.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic'). In the `Search Paths` section, look for `Header Search Paths` and make sure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../../React` - mark both as `recursive`.\n5. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)\n\n\n#### Android\n1. `npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save`\n2. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java\n  - Add `import com.lwansbrough.RCTCamera.RCTCameraPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file\n  - Add `new RCTCameraPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method. Add a comma to the previous item if there's already something there.\n\n3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:\n\n\t```\n\tinclude ':react-native-camera'\n\tproject(':react-native-camera').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, \t'../node_modules/react-native-camera/android')\n\t```\n\n4. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n\n\t```\n    compile project(':react-native-camera')\n\t```\n5. Declare the permissions in your Android Manifest (required for `video recording` feature)\n\n  ```\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\"/>\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_VIDEO\"/>\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" />\n  ```\n\n## Usage\n\nAll you need is to `require` the `react-native-camera` module and then use the\n`<Camera/>` tag.\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {\n  AppRegistry,\n  Dimensions,\n  StyleSheet,\n  Text,\n  TouchableHighlight,\n  View\n} from 'react-native';\nimport Camera from 'react-native-camera';\n\nclass BadInstagramCloneApp extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View style={styles.container}>\n        <Camera\n          ref={(cam) => {\n            this.camera = cam;\n          }}\n          style={styles.preview}\n          aspect={Camera.constants.Aspect.fill}>\n          <Text style={styles.capture} onPress={this.takePicture.bind(this)}>[CAPTURE]</Text>\n        </Camera>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n\n  takePicture() {\n    const options = {};\n    //options.location = ...\n    this.camera.capture({metadata: options})\n      .then((data) => console.log(data))\n      .catch(err => console.error(err));\n  }\n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  container: {\n    flex: 1,\n    flexDirection: 'row',\n  },\n  preview: {\n    flex: 1,\n    justifyContent: 'flex-end',\n    alignItems: 'center'\n  },\n  capture: {\n    flex: 0,\n    backgroundColor: '#fff',\n    borderRadius: 5,\n    color: '#000',\n    padding: 10,\n    margin: 40\n  }\n});\n\nAppRegistry.registerComponent('BadInstagramCloneApp', () => BadInstagramCloneApp);\n```\n\n## Properties\n\n#### `aspect`\n\nValues: `Camera.constants.Aspect.fit` or `\"fit\"`, `Camera.constants.Aspect.fill` or `\"fill\"` (default), `Camera.constants.Aspect.stretch` or `\"stretch\"`\n\nThe `aspect` property allows you to define how your viewfinder renders the camera's view. For instance, if you have a square viewfinder and you want to fill the it entirely, you have two options: `\"fill\"`, where the aspect ratio of the camera's view is preserved by cropping the view or `\"stretch\"`, where the aspect ratio is skewed in order to fit the entire image inside the viewfinder. The other option is `\"fit\"`, which ensures the camera's entire view fits inside your viewfinder without altering the aspect ratio.\n\n#### `iOS` `captureAudio`\n\nValues: `true` (Boolean), `false` (default)\n\n*Applies to video capture mode only.* Specifies whether or not audio should be captured with the video.\n\n\n#### `captureMode`\n\nValues: `Camera.constants.CaptureMode.still` (default), `Camera.constants.CaptureMode.video`\n\nThe type of capture that will be performed by the camera - either a still image or video.\n\n#### `captureTarget`\n\nValues: `Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.cameraRoll` (default), `Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.disk`, `Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.temp`, ~~`Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.memory`~~ (deprecated),\n\nThis property allows you to specify the target output of the captured image data. The disk output has been shown to improve capture response time, so that is the recommended value. When using the deprecated memory output, the image binary is sent back as a base64-encoded string.\n\n#### `captureQuality`\n\nValues: `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality.high` or `\"high\"` (default), `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality.medium` or `\"medium\"`, `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality.low` or `\"low\"`, `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality.photo` or `\"photo\"`, `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality[\"1080p\"]` or `\"1080p\"`, `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality[\"720p\"]` or `\"720p\"`, `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality[\"480p\"]` or `\"480p\"`.\n\nThis property allows you to specify the quality output of the captured image or video. By default the quality is set to high.\n\nWhen choosing more-specific quality settings (1080p, 720p, 480p), note that each platform and device supports different valid picture/video sizes, and actual resolution within each of these quality settings might differ. There should not be too much variance (if any) for iOS; 1080p should give 1920x1080, 720p should give 1280x720, and 480p should give 640x480 (note that iOS 480p therefore is NOT the typical 16:9 HD aspect ratio, and the typically-HD camera preview screen may differ greatly in aspect from what you actually record!!). For Android, expect more variance: on most Androids, 1080p *should* give 1920x1080 and 720p *should* give 1280x720; however, 480p will at \"best\" be 853x480 (16:9 HD aspect ratio), but falls back/down to 800x480, 720x480, or \"worse\", depending on what is closest-but-less-than 853x480 and available on the actual device. If your application requires knowledge of the precise resolution of the output image/video, you might consider manually determine the actual resolution itself after capture has completed (particularly for 480p on Android).\n\nAndroid also supports `Camera.constants.CaptureQuality.preview` or `\"preview\"` which matches the output image to the same one used in the preview\n\n#### `type`\n\nValues: `Camera.constants.Type.front` or `\"front\"`, `Camera.constants.Type.back` or `\"back\"` (default)\n\nUse the `type` property to specify which camera to use.\n\n\n#### `orientation`\n\nValues:\n`Camera.constants.Orientation.auto` or `\"auto\"` (default),\n`Camera.constants.Orientation.landscapeLeft` or `\"landscapeLeft\"`, `Camera.constants.Orientation.landscapeRight` or `\"landscapeRight\"`, `Camera.constants.Orientation.portrait` or `\"portrait\"`, `Camera.constants.Orientation.portraitUpsideDown` or `\"portraitUpsideDown\"`\n\nThe `orientation` property allows you to specify the current orientation of the phone to ensure the viewfinder is \"the right way up.\"\n\n#### `Android` `playSoundOnCapture`\n\nValues: `true` (default) or `false`\n\nThis property allows you to specify whether a shutter sound is played on capture. It is currently android only, pending [a reasonable mute implementation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4401232/avfoundation-how-to-turn-off-the-shutter-sound-when-capturestillimageasynchrono) in iOS.\n\n#### `onBarCodeRead`\n\nWill call the specified method when a barcode is detected in the camera's view.\n\nEvent contains `data` (the data in the barcode) and `bounds` (the rectangle which outlines the barcode.)\n\nThe following barcode types can be recognised:\n\n- `aztec`\n- `code128`\n- `code39`\n- `code39mod43`\n- `code93`\n- `ean13`\n- `ean8`\n- `pdf417`\n- `qr`\n- `upce`\n- `interleaved2of5` (when available)\n- `itf14` (when available)\n- `datamatrix` (when available)\n\nThe barcode type is provided in the `data` object.\n\n#### `barCodeTypes`\n\nAn array of barcode types to search for. Defaults to all types listed above. No effect if `onBarCodeRead` is undefined.\n\n#### `flashMode`\n\nValues:\n`Camera.constants.FlashMode.on`,\n`Camera.constants.FlashMode.off`,\n`Camera.constants.FlashMode.auto`\n\nUse the `flashMode` property to specify the camera flash mode.\n\n#### `torchMode`\n\nValues:\n`Camera.constants.TorchMode.on`,\n`Camera.constants.TorchMode.off`,\n`Camera.constants.TorchMode.auto`\n\nUse the `torchMode` property to specify the camera torch mode.\n\n#### `iOS` `onFocusChanged: Event { nativeEvent: { touchPoint: { x, y } }`\n\niOS: Called when a touch focus gesture has been made.\nBy default, `onFocusChanged` is not defined and tap-to-focus is disabled.\n\nAndroid: This callback is not yet implemented. However, Android will\nautomatically do tap-to-focus if the device supports auto-focus; there is\ncurrently no way to manage this from javascript.\n\n#### `iOS` `defaultOnFocusComponent`\n\nValues:\n`true` (default)\n`false`\n\nIf `defaultOnFocusComponent` set to false, default internal implementation of visual feedback for tap-to-focus gesture will be disabled.\n\n#### `iOS` `onZoomChanged: Event { nativeEvent: { velocity, zoomFactor } }`\n\niOS: Called when focus has changed.\nBy default, `onZoomChanged` is not defined and pinch-to-zoom is disabled.\n\nAndroid: This callback is not yet implemented. However, Android will\nautomatically handle pinch-to-zoom; there is currently no way to manage this\nfrom javascript.\n\n#### `iOS` `keepAwake`\n\nIf set to `true`, the device will not sleep while the camera preview is visible. This mimics the behavior of the default camera app, which keeps the device awake while open.\n\n#### `mirrorImage`\n\nIf set to `true`, the image returned will be mirrored.\n\n#### `fixOrientation` (_deprecated_)\n\nIf set to `true`, the image returned will be rotated to the _right way up_.  WARNING: It uses a significant amount of memory and my cause your application to crash if the device cannot provide enough RAM to perform the rotation.\n\n(_If you find that you need to use this option because your images are incorrectly oriented by default,\ncould please submit a PR and include the make model of the device.  We believe that it's not \nrequired functionality any more and would like to remove it._) \n\n## Component instance methods\n\nYou can access component methods by adding a `ref` (ie. `ref=\"camera\"`) prop to your `<Camera>` element, then you can use `this.refs.camera.capture(cb)`, etc. inside your component.\n\n#### `capture([options]): Promise`\n\nCaptures data from the camera. What is captured is based on the `captureMode` and `captureTarget` props. `captureMode` tells the camera whether you want a still image or video. `captureTarget` allows you to specify how you want the data to be captured and sent back to you. See `captureTarget` under Properties to see the available values.\n\nSupported options:\n\n - `audio` (See `captureAudio` under Properties)\n - `mode` (See  `captureMode` under Properties)\n - `target` (See `captureTarget` under Properties)\n - `metadata` This is metadata to be added to the captured image.\n   - `location` This is the object returned from `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` (React Native's geolocation polyfill). It will add GPS metadata to the image.\n - `rotation` This will rotate the image by the number of degrees specified.\n - `jpegQuality` (integer between 1 and 100) This property is used to compress the output jpeg file with 100% meaning no jpeg compression will be applied.\n - `totalSeconds` This will limit video length by number of seconds specified. Only works in video capture mode.\n\nThe promise will be fulfilled with an object with some of the following properties:\n\n - `data`: Returns a base64-encoded string with the capture data (only returned with the deprecated `Camera.constants.CaptureTarget.memory`)\n - `path`: Returns the path of the captured image or video file on disk\n - `width`: (currently iOS video only) returns the video file's frame width\n - `height`: (currently iOS video only) returns the video file's frame height\n - `duration`: (currently iOS video only) video file duration\n - `size`: (currently iOS video only) video file size (in bytes)\n\n#### `iOS` `getFOV(): Promise`\n\nReturns the camera's current field of view.\n\n#### `hasFlash(): Promise`\n\nReturns whether or not the camera has flash capabilities.\n\n#### `stopCapture()`\n\nEnds the current capture session for video captures. Only applies when the current `captureMode` is `video`.\n\n## Component static methods\n\n#### `iOS` `Camera.checkDeviceAuthorizationStatus(): Promise`\n\nExposes the native API for checking if the device has authorized access to the camera (camera and microphone permissions). Can be used to call before loading the Camera component to ensure proper UX. The promise will be fulfilled with `true` or `false` depending on whether the device is authorized. Note, [as of iOS 10](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/PhotoCaptureGuide/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017511-CH1-DontLinkElementID_3), you will need to add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your XCode project's Info.plist file or you might experience a crash.\n\n#### `iOS` `Camera.checkVideoAuthorizationStatus(): Promise`\n\nThe same as `Camera.checkDeviceAuthorizationStatus()` but only checks the camera permission. Note, as of iOS 10, you will need to add `NSCameraUsageDescription` to your XCode project's Info.plist file or you might experience a crash.\n\n#### `iOS` `Camera.checkAudioAuthorizationStatus(): Promise`\n\nThe same as `Camera.checkDeviceAuthorizationStatus()` but only checks the microphone permission. Note, as of iOS 10, you will need to add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your XCode project's Info.plist file or you might experience a crash.\n\n## Subviews\nThis component supports subviews, so if you wish to use the camera view as a background or if you want to layout buttons/images/etc. inside the camera then you can do that.\n\n## Example\n\nTo see more of the `react-native-camera` in action, you can check out the source in [Example](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera/tree/master/Example) folder.\n\n\n## Open Collective\nWe are just beginning a funding campaign for react-native-camera. Contributions are greatly appreciated. When we gain more than $250 we will begin distributing funds to core maintainers in a fully transparent manner. Feedback for this process is welcomed, we will continue to evolve the strategy as we grow and learn more.\n\n### Backers\n\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.
