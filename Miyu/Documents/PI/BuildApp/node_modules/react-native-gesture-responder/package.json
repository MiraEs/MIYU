  "readme": "# react-native-gesture-responder\n\nA more convenient and powerful gesture responder than the official PanResponder.\n\nUsing this library, gestures are easy to detect:\n\n* scroll distance\n* pinch distance\n* single tap\n* double tab\n* single tap confirmed (not followed by a double tap)\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install --save react-native-gesture-responder@latest`\n\n## Documentation\n\n```\nimport {createResponder} from 'react-native-gesture-responder';\n...\ncomponentWillMount() {\n  this.gestureResponder = createResponder({\n    onStartShouldSetResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n    onStartShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n    onMoveShouldSetResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n    onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n    onResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {},\n    onResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {},\n    onResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,\n    onResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {},\n    onResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {},\n    \n    onResponderSingleTapConfirmed: (evt, gestureState) => {},\n    \n    moveThreshold: 2,\n    debug: false\n  });\n}\n\nrender() {\n  \n  return (\n    <View\n      {...this.gestureResponder}>\n\t\t...\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe API is quite same with the **[official gesture responder system](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html)**. Differences are:\n\n1. Every lifecycle callback is called with an additional argument **gestureState**, like the **[PanResponder](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/panresponder.html)**.\n\n2. **onResponderSingleTapConfirmed**: called after a single tap (not a double tap).\n\n3. **moveThreshold**: default is 2. Use this to avoid too sensitive move events when simply tap the screen(mainly on Android).\n\n4. **debug**: a boolean value. If true, lifecycle logs will be printed.\n\n   â€‹\n\nThe **gestureState** object has the following(a super set of *PanResponder*):\n\n* `stateId`\n* `moveX` and `moveY`\n* `x0` and `y0`\n* `dx` and `dy`: **accumulated** distance of the gesture since the touch started(confusing names)\n* `vx` and `vy`: per millisec(PanResponder is inconsistant with different react-native version, as [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/8104) mentioned)\n* `numberActiveTouches`\n* `previousMoveX` and `previousMoveY`: you can use `moveX - previousMoveX` to calculate latest move distance\n* `pinch` and `previousPinch`: useful number values when implementing zoom feature. Will be undefined if no pinch occured\n* `singleTapUp`: a bool value indicating if a single tap up occured\n* `doubleTapUp`: a bool value indicating if a double tap up occured\n\n\n\n\nRefer to *Demo* folder for a simple demonstration, as below shows:\n\n![](Demo/demo.gif)\n",
